# [Think Python 2nd Edition](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)

These are the notes I took while reading this book, as well as my solutions to any exercises I decided to do.

My objective while reading this book was to back-fill my understanding of basic python stuff, as I originally learned python on-the-job to add to an existing project and only learned what was relevant to what I was doing.


There is a `.md` file for each chapter which contains the notes I took while reading that chapter as well as my solutions to any exercises.

I did not do all the exercises; once I felt I had a good understanding of the topic of the current chapter I would move on to the next chapter. I would also skip an exercise if it was a brain teaser or a math problem.
